# MathLab Phone Connection Visualizer
[The project can be viewed here](https://elihschiff.github.io/Math-Problem-Solution-Visualizer/)

In Smallville, there are 15 telephones. Can they be connected by wires so that each telephone is connected with exactly 5 others?

This program is meant to help visualize the answer to the math question stated above. For a solution to be valid all groups of lines must be of equal size. Therefore having 15 telephones with 5 connections is not a valid solution. However 15 telephones with 4 connections is.


This project was made using p5.js which is a javascript graphics library.
